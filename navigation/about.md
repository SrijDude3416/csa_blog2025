## Who am I?

Well, my LinkedIn says that I'm a "High school junior with a love for all things AI" but I think I'm a lot of things.
Let's break down some of my interests:

## Computer programming
Ever since 4th grade I've been deeply enamored by all things computer science. 
To fulfill my desire to explore the field in a more organized fashion, I've chosen to take both AP CSP (2023-24) and AP CSA (2024-25 ongoing).

I've been programming on my own for a while, but this class has helped me become more organized in my work. To be honest, I thought that CSP was getting on my butt about a lot of things that I didn't really think were that important. 

That is... until I had my first internship working at NASA. ![](../images/nasa.png) Ideas such as the AGILE methodology and live tech talks were something I had to deal with on a weekly basis, and the tools/tricks I learned in CSP really helped me out. I'd say I did pretty well considering I got extended into the Fall term as well.

## Watches
I'll admit that my interest in watches is fairly new one. It started this past summer when I got to see the inside of a watch for the first time. The idea that people spend their whole lives honing a machine with a purpose as simple as telling to time, to be as precise as possible is beautiful to me. It shows the dedication, love, and passion they have for the work they do and I found those attributes admirable. I found myself diving into the world of watch mechanisms and trying to understand a little more as each day went on.
